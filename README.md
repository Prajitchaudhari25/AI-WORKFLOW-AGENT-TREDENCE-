# AI-WORKFLOW-AGENT-TREDENCE-
This project is a simple workflow engine built using FastAPI. It allows workflows to be defined as a graph with nodes and edges and then executed step by step using an initial state. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how basic agent-style workflows can be created, run, and tested through API endpoints in a clean and easy-to-understand way.
